Sketches are widely used in many applications due to their high accuracy, memory efficiency and fast speed.
However, many real datasets are non-uniform, and sketches are not accurate enough for these datasets because of high probability of hash collisions.
To address this issue, in this paper, we propose a novel technique for sketches, named \fname~(\aname), which enables exisiting sketches to achieve higher accuray with few extra costs.
The key idea of our \aname~technique is to use different parameters like width and counter size in different arrays in a sketch.
We apply our technique to several typical sketches, including CM sketches and CU sketches.
We also conduct comprehensive mathematical analysis and extensive experiments to prove that sketches perform better after using our technique.
Experimental results show that our \aname~technique is ...
We believe our \aname~technique can be widely applied to many sketches.
